                <td>Dr , I want to know about pharmacokinetic?</td>
                <td>Pharmacokinetic is a study of drug movement. It involves the following Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion.</td>

        <td>Dr, What happen when drug enters our blood stream. Please clarify ?</td>
        <td>Once in the bloodstream, the drug is distributed throughout the body. The distribution is influenced by blood flow, the drug's affinity for tissue, and the permeability of cell membranes. The volume of distribution is a key parameter that describes the extent to which a drug is distributed in the body's tissues.</td>

        <td>Dr I don't understand volume of distribution . Is it the same at each parts of the body.</td>
        <td>Volume of distribution (VOT): theoretical volume that represents the degree to which a drug is distributed in the body tissues and in the plasma. It is the same throughout the body.</td>

        <td>5</td>
        <td>24/03/2023</td>
        <td>Dr , why there are two stages in metabolism of drug . please detail it</td>
        <td>Metabolism has two main phases. Functionalise reactions (Phase 1) and (Phase 2) Conjugation reactions. Drug metabolism converts lipophilic chemical compounds into more readily excreted hydrophilic products. Involves TWO phases of metabolism, This process generally increases the water solubility of the drug, facilitating its excretion in urine or bile. Phase II reactions typically result in detoxification but, in some cases, can also produce active or even toxic metabolites</td>

        <td>Dr can you briefly explain the toxicology?</td>

        <td>How about receptors Dr ?All drugs must bind to its receptors to produce its effects? So enzymes are also receptors ?</td>
        <td>Receptors are responsible for selectivity of drug action. The molecular size, shape, and electrical charge of a drug determine whether—and with what affinity—it will bind to a particular receptor among the vast array of chemically different binding sites available in a cell, tissue, or patient. Yes, enzymes also one of the receptors. Receptors are typically proteins including, ion channels, or G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), that play critical roles in cellular function.</td>

                <td>Dr Aliana, is specificity and Affinity has similar definition in Drug-Receptor Interactions</td>
                <td>No, Specificity means the drug is designed to bind to specific receptors based on the shape, charge, and chemical properties of the drug molecule. This specificity determines the selectivity of the drug's action. Affinity refers to the strength of the drug-receptor binding. Drugs with high affinity for their receptors will bind more tightly and usually require lower doses to achieve a therapeutic effect. Affinity is influenced by the chemical structure of the drug and the receptor.</td>

                <td>Efficacy of drug means drug binds to receptor and elicit response. Is it the same with potency?</td>

                <td>Dr why inverse agonist has opposite effects than agonist?</td>
                <td>Inverse agonists bind to the same receptor as agonists but induce a pharmacological response opposite to that of agonists. They stabilize the receptor in its inactive conformation, reducing its activity below the basal level. They are particularly relevant for receptors that exhibit constitutive activity, meaning the receptor is active even in the absence of a ligand.</td>

                <td>How partial agonist work Dr</td>
                <td>As the name implies, partial agonists bind to and activates a receptor but produces a weaker, or partial, response compared to a full agonist. Partial agonists have intermediate efficacy; they can activate receptor but not to the full extent that a full agonist can. In the presence of a full agonist, partial agonists can act as competitive antagonists because they can compete for the same receptor sites and reduce the overall effect by occupying receptors without producing a maximal response.</td>
